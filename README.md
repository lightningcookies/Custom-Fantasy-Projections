# Custom-Fantasy-Projections
A spreadsheet that will allow you to go team by team projecting fantasy output just like the professionals do it!  This will be helpful in your own fantasy leagues/best ball!
Current Features:
1. 2022 Fantasy results 
2. 2023 Team rosters for QB, RB, WR, and TE positions.
3. Compare this year's to last year's statistics team by team

Working on:
1. Finishing Excel and VBA
2. input and output a CSV file of your projections for editing/viewing
3. Custom fantasy scoring (currently ____ scoring only) 

Instructions:
1. Download _____ and open
2. Allow macro's.
3. Fill out team-by-team projections. I suggest referencing betting markets & other fantasy projections
4. head to the home page, press buttons that will execute macro's. These will
   a. Create a top 200 overall by projected fantasy points
   b. Create a top list for QB, RB, WR, and TE and put them in separate sheets
   c. ----Coming soon---- import/export CSV of your rankings in a compact form

This is my summer hobby project! If you like what you see, please give it a star :) I am currently studying statistics/Data Science at BYU & am looking for an internship

Any suggestions are more than welcome! I'm new to GitHub and open-sourcing so please be patient. I especially would love any help with VBA and automating the spreadsheet better.

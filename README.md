# Custom-Fantasy-Projections
This repository was built using R to create a template spreadsheet that will allow you to go team by team projecting fantasy output just like the professionals! This aims tow be helpful in your own fantasy football/best ball leagues! It's easy to get caught up on players you like, but are your projections in line with where you would draft him? Don't worry about all the nitty-gritty R scripts and macros, I have made it all neat inside one spreadsheet file. If you are interested, feel free to dive deep and see how I created this template!
## Current Features:
1. 2023 Fantasy football stats and results for reference.
2. 2024 Team rosters for QB, RB, WR, and TE positions.
3. Compare this year's to last year's statistics team by team.
4. Input your own custom scoring format for your league.
5. Get overall rankings for individual positions and overall.

## Instructions for download and use:
1. Download [CustomProjectionsV1](https://github.com/lightningcookies/Custom-Fantasy-Projections/raw/main/CustomProjectionsV1.xlsm) and save to your system.
3. Open with Microsoft Excel and in the top bar, click to Editing. A security-risk pop-up should appear. In order to get positonal rankings and overall rankings, macro's have to be enabled. You should never allow macros in a file from someone you don't trust, although my hope is that you'll trust me & trust the fact that anyone can check the macro's(because it's open source).
- If you feel comfortable enabling macros, here is how you do it:
- In most cases you can unblock macros by modifying the properties of the file as follows:
- Open Windows File Explorer and go to the folder where you saved the file.
- Right-click the file and choose Properties from the context menu.
- At the bottom of the General tab, select the Unblock checkbox and select OK.
4. Fill out team-by-team projections. I suggest referencing betting markets & other fantasy projections. For example, [DK sportsbook's player stats odds](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/leagues/football/nfl?category=player-stats) or [FantasyPro's Fantasy Football projections](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/projections/rb.php?week=draft) should both give you a good idea about players.
5. head to the home page, press the "Refresh button" that will execute macro's. These will 3 macros will...
- Create/update a sheet called "Overall" by combining every player's projection.
- Create/update a combined list for QB, RB, WR, and TE and put them in separate sheets.
- Apply table style again in case it gets screwed up and looks messy. 

### Extra
This was my 2023 summer hobby project! If you like what you see, please give it a star :) I just graduated with a BS in statistics: data science at BYU. My hope is that I can present this project to potential employers as proof of my skills :) 

Any suggestions are more than welcome! I'm new to GitHub and open-sourcing so please be patient. I especially would love any help with VBA and automating the spreadsheet better.

## Working on for next year:
1. more spreadsheet automation
2. adding more advance stats
3. adding more graphs and historical context
4. learn more about macros and not rely on LLM's.
